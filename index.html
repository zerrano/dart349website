          <h2>Welcome, welcome</h2>
           <p>Welcome all to the website of an ambiguous designer. The name's Timothy Serrano. I'm 24, and i'm an odd mix of Filippino, Spanish and Korean. As I study at Concordia University, i'm currently studying Computation Arts. My main hobbies are video games, Digital Arts, and PC building. I’m currently looking for a road in life where I can mix my 3 hobbies into a healthy lifestyle, with ofcourse, some decent profit. Of course, that’s all wishful thinking, a long term goal that requires a lot of blood sweat and tears to achieve, but alas it is my driving force. </p>
