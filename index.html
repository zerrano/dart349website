          <h2>Welcome, welcome</h2>
           <p>Welcome all to the website of an ambiguous designer. The name's Timothy Serrano. I'm 24, and i'm Filippino, Spanish and korean. I currently go to Concordia University, and i'm currently studying Computation Arts. My main hobbies are video games, Digital Arts, and PC building. I’m currently looking for a road in life where I can mix my 3 hobbies into a healthy lifestyle, while making decent money. Of course, that’s all wishful thinking, a long term goal that requires a lot of blood sweat and tears to achieve, but alas it is my dream lifestyle. </p>
