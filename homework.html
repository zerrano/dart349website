    <h2>Critical TechWorks </h2>

    <h4>_______________</h4>
    <p>The first website I have for review is the Critical TechWorks website. Critical TechWorks appears to be a company that has partnered with BMW in an attempt to "change the way the world thinks and feels about cars". The website itself is scroll-interactive that features really clean, minimal transitions and background animations. Featuring purely sans-serif fonts, the site conveys its message using text that is straight to the point, scroll-sensitive photo galleries, and  They don't beat around the bush with what they're trying to tell you the moment you enter the site. All nav elements feature a transition when hovered over that sticks to the site's theme of blue, black, white and teal, as well as highlighting important words that hold more volume than others using color coded words. A well themed site that brings the concept of minimal to extreme heights. Worthy of being featured on awwwards.com.</p>

    <h2>Solar Digital </h2>

    <h4>_______________</h4>
    <p>Solar Digital is a website that features professional grade, high quality, clean UX/UI design, with a huge emphasis on skills with complex website-user interactions. The site carefully balances their messages, with design choices, and functionality. The site itself, feels like a morphing pool of water, where there is a small animation at the bottom of the screen encourages the user to drag and drop images into the canvas on the left half of the left, to "morph" the canvas into whatever it is the user has dragged, and dropped. Such an action compliments UI design as it makes the user interact with web elements, to traverse through the author's work. </p>

    <h2>VLNC Studio </h2>
    <h4>_______________</h4>
    <a href = "http://www.vlnc.studio/">

    <h4>_______________</h4>
    <p>VLNC Studio is an Art & Design Studio based in Paris. Being a contemporary Art Studio, they feature skillsets in Branding, interactive design, concept, UX/UI design, Graphic Design, Advertising, and film direction. The company appears to boast a contemporary style, and it reflects in its overall website design. Simple elements that other websites feature, like a home, about, contact page, etc, all appear to be somewhat difficult to spot at first, and requires the user to do a bit of exploring just to find. For an average user, this may prove difficult. The interactivity of the website is very bare-bones; scroll-sensitive material appears as you go down the site. The design of this website is were it truly shines in comparison to the other two websites I reviewed. VLNC features beautiful art pieces that appear in many creative ways. From a slideshow that appears at your cursor location, to multiple photogalleries that are beautifully accessed, the site boasts a unique style and atmosphere that Solar Digital, and Critical Techworks seem to lack. VLNC boasts consistency in its artistic theme.</p>
