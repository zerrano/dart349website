      <p>It is important to take the time to take care of oneâ€™s health, and normally when you feel unwell, sick or even find yourself injured, one thinks about taking a trip to the doctors to get checked out or at the very least finding some medicine
        and remedies to treat themselves at home. But what often becomes overlooked and ignored is our mental health, which is a surprise because of how many people are affected with different mental health problems. </p>
