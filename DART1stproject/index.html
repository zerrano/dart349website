        For my proposal, I have decided to choose the topic of <a>censorship</a>. <a>Censorship</a> is considered an old-fashioned method of suppression and control for media elements that are considered to have repercussions to specific individuals. It is a form of control that continues to grow more obsolete, and is continuing to be more and more considered as a nuisance than protection as the younger generations began to mature much earlier than the generations before it.

      <h2><a>Wireframe</a>, and Design</h2>

      <p>
        <br />For my general wireframe, and design, I plan on incorporating a scroll-intensive, scroll-friendly style of website. Most of my website panels will be subdivided into micro pages. Rather than producing multiple html pages, I plan on incorporating all my content into one big, stackable, and scroll-friendly experience. Most panels will feature 2 main columns: either both for typography, or one reserved for images, and the other for typography. The scroll-snapping will be on the Y-Axis, not the X-axis. Each panel should feature a general theme based on the current ploint in the essay.

      <h2><a>Annoying</a> isn’t it? </h2>
      <p class="essay">Welcome to censorship, the concept that makes you hate black boxes, and pixelated faces. Censorship at the core, is nothing more than a cover, a filter, or anything that can be used to mask/distort the form of information in fear of repercussions. Censorship goes as far back as 399 BC, when the Greek philosopher, Socrates, while defying attempts by the Greek state to censor his philosophical teachings, was accused of collateral charges related to the corruption of Athenian youth and sentenced to death by drinking poisonous hemlock. (Wikipedia) It is a form of control that dates way back to a much more oppressive era that continues to get frowned upon as the generations pass by. Youths are learning uncensored content faster than its becoming censored in todays day and age thanks to how powerful, and vast the world wide web has become. The internets existence is a complete contradiction to why censorship existed in the first place, and is constantly in a state of conflict with one another.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Powerful world conflicts like the World Wars, or Civil wars, rely heavily on influence to rally the general population into picking a side to fight on, and we have learned from the past how powerful propaganda can become, if it is not kept under control. Incidents like this are where censorship is highly enforced.

      <p class="essay">However, conflicts have gone down in numbers over the generations, and with the enforcement of freedom of speech, getting stronger with each passing year, the usage of censorship is beginning to be seen more as a nuisance and an old dated culture. The level and severity of censorship is strongly dependant of the country, and the culture that is exercised.</p>
      <p><br />When freedom of speech through the internet was the pinnacle of government-free expression, many took to this platform to share their ideologies, experiences, secrets and propaganda to the world. But just like laws and borders, the internet eventually became regulated in each and every country, when it was becoming clear just how much of a global impact (or connection) the internet is creating, and how the power of anonymous information exchange can influence one country after another. One extreme example is one of the global superpowers: China. </p>

      <h2><a>China</a></h2>
      <p class="essay">
        China fears the internet. It has every right to do so since China is the most populated country in the world. China fears how the internet can easily influence its massive population, and because of this, the entire Chinese network is heavily monitored, and regulated accordingly. The Chinese government is very protective of what kind of external information makes it past their digital borders, as well as keeping a plethora of secrets from leaking out. The cause of this severe level of censorship isn’t entirely the fault of the Chinese government. Chinese social media plays a large hand in regulations as well.

        Throughout my final project, I plan on incorporating a kind of “guerrilla-tactics” themed website that aims on showing you information, only when you’ve put in some minimal effort to get said-information revealed. Much like the annoyance of censorship, some aspects of my website will be hidden behind easy-to-reveal elements such as black censorship boxes, pixelation, etc. Under the assumption that what the viewer is trying to see is something prohibited, will only be greeted by something they already know about; much like how censorship hides that which most of today’s generation knows about. <br />Swearing, mild racism, mild nudity, even online pornography is easily acessable to most youth who know how to interact with a computer or phone. That level of ease will be incorporated into hiding simple words.
      </p>

        <br />
        As mentioned earlier, the main target of my essay will be China. China has some of the most extreme levels of censorship to the point where the government controls how its society sees the rest of the world. They will outright ban or censor anything that the Chinese government considers “harmful” or “unnecessary” to the general Chinese population such as American Movies, popular celebrities, specific songs, imagery, even youtube content creators. The Chinese government goes as far as completely blocking any form of search results from within the Chinese borders from any of the banned topics. It is controlling, manipulative, and strips the Chinese population of access to a lot of useful sources of information outside their borders, and is a topic that is much debated.
